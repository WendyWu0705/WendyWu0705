# Hi there 👋
My name is Wendy and I’m a postgraduate student at the University of Bristol, majoring in Financial Technology with Data Science.

My interests center on algorithms and data-driven decision-making in the financial sector. I’m eager to leverage my interdisciplinary background in finance, statistics, and programming to contribute to innovative, data-informed financial solutions.
